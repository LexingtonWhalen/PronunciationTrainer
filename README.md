## :grey_question: What is it?
* Many people try "shadowing" when learning languages. See more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_shadowing
* I thought that I would make a program that would help with that. 
* Basically, the program displays a word (in target language) along with its audio wave form. You can then record your pronunciation and compare the waveforms.
